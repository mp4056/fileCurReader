Personal practice on Java I/O, map converting to JSON and multi-threading (completableFuture) 

My Difficulty Rate:

4 stars out of 10; //for the I/O part
8 stars out of 10; //for the multi-threading part

Personal Thoughts On The Practice:

Day 7 after started this practice on April 10th. 
The I/O part did not take me too much time to finish and felt great of knowing a new tool jackson-databind, super convenient data converter!
But I have to say to figure out how multi-threading works does rack my brains since this is my first try using completableFuture 
(spent nearly 5 days and I'm still working on it lol).
